excerpt: My research is focused on understanding how **changes in climate, glaciation, and land use impact the morphology of river catchments**. My work connects landscapes of the icy past during the Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 20,000 years ago) to more modern changes caused by Euro-American farming and paraglacial (or post-glacial) landscape evolution. <br><br>I address my research questions using a number of approaches, including optically stimulated luminescence and <sup>10</sup>Be cosmogenic nuclide dating, DEM analysis of watershed-scale morphology and channel networks, detailed sediment description, and passive/active source seismic methods.

## Research Projects
### Axe vs Ice Age: Human and climatic impacts on erosion rates in the Whitewater River Basin
 
Euro-American settlement irrevocably altered the landscapes of the Upper Midwest and dramatically increased erosion and sedimentation within river valleys. In this project I use a paired geochronology (cosmogenic 10Be and optically stimulated luminescence) approach to construct a pre-settlement, late Pleistocene paleoerosion chronology to better contextualize the impacts of Euro-American agriculture on this landscape. I additionally relate paleoerosion rate variability to paleoenvironmental shifts prior to settlement.

### Identifying Glacially-Derived outwash sediments
 
 
### Last Glacial Maximum retreat of the Lago Argentino Outlet Lobe

In this collaborative project (led by Matias Romero, University of Wisconsin Madison), we are working to constrain the ice lobe retreat and paraglacial landscape response of the Lago Argentino outlet lobe of the Southern Patagonian Ice Sheet. The project uses remotely sensed data and field-based geochronology (10Be and infrared stimulated luminescence) to map and date glacial features in the Rio Santa Cruz valley. In this project, I collected and processed IRSL samples of paraglacial landforms in the valley to further develop the paraglacial evolution of the valley.
