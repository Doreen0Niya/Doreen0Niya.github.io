## Research Interests

My research is focused on understanding how changes in glaciation impact the morphology and dynamics of river networks. My work is primarily focused on the Whitewater River, a tributary to the Mississippi River in southeastern Minnesota, USA.

My research is centered around three main questions:
1. How do the changes in water and sediment supply and changes in base level caused by ice sheets impact downstream and tributary river systems?
2. How do changes in erosion and deposition evolve across different timescales?
As the watershed transitioned from ancient bedrock erosion to terrace aggradation and abandonment, how did erosion rates change?
3. How do mixed alluvial-bedrock systems respond to changes in base level in real, natural systems? Can we ground truth models of this evolution with real world field data?

I address these key research questions through a number of approaches, including optically stimulated luminescence and meteoric cosmogenic nuclide dating, DEM analysis of watershed-scale morphology and channel networks, detailed sediment description, and passive/active source seismic methods.
