## Research Interests

My research is focused on understanding how changes in climate, glaciation, and land use impact the morphology of river catchments. My work connects landscapes of the icy past at the Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 20,000 years ago) to more modern changes caused by Euro-American farming and paraglacial (or post-glacial) landscape evolution. 

My work is primarily focused on the Whitewater River, a tributary to the Mississippi River in southeastern Minnesota, USA. The Whitewater River was not glaciated at the Last Glacial Maximum, but glacial climate and changes in base level (the water level at the mouth of the river) due to glacial advance and retreat had far-reaching impacts on this watershed. The Whitewater River was further altered by the start of Euro-American farming in the 1850s, which resulted in considerable vegetation clearing and the introduction of plowing. These land use changes had devastating consequences on this landscape, resulting in massive floods and debris flows that buried towns and destroyed farmland.

My research is centered around three main questions:

1. How has erosion changed in this catchment from the Last Glacial Maximum through the introduction of Euro-American agriculture and into the present?

To address this question, I am using new applications of two geochronologic techniques (optically stimulated luminescence and 10Be cosmogenic nuclide sampling) to constrain erosion rates recorded in sediment deeply buried in modern fluvial terraces (abandoned floodplains). I use this combined approach to understand erosion in a number of different time scales.

2. How do the changes in water and sediment supply and changes in base level caused by ice sheets impact downstream and tributary river systems?


2. How do changes in erosion and deposition evolve across different timescales?
As the watershed transitioned from ancient bedrock erosion to terrace aggradation and abandonment, how did erosion rates change?
3. How do mixed alluvial-bedrock systems respond to changes in base level in real, natural systems? Can we ground truth models of this evolution with real world field data?

I address these key research questions through a number of approaches, including optically stimulated luminescence and 10Be cosmogenic nuclide dating, DEM analysis of watershed-scale morphology and channel networks, detailed sediment description, and passive/active source seismic methods.

I have been fortunate enough to work in both the field and lab on both optically stimulated luminescence and 10Be nuclide dating, courtesy of Utah State University and University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am passionate about connecting landscapes, processes, and scientific approaches in new and exciting ways. I'm eager to collaborate with new people and talk more about my research. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
