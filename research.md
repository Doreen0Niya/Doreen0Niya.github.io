## Research Interests

My research is focused on understanding how changes in climate, glaciation, and land use impact the morphology of river catchments. My work connects landscapes of the icy past during the Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 20,000 years ago) to more modern changes caused by Euro-American farming and paraglacial (or post-glacial) landscape evolution.

I address my research questions through a number of approaches, including optically stimulated luminescence and 10Be cosmogenic nuclide dating, DEM analysis of watershed-scale morphology and channel networks, detailed sediment description, and passive/active source seismic methods.

### Field Area

My work is primarily focused on the Whitewater River, a tributary to the Mississippi River in southeastern Minnesota, USA. The Whitewater River was not glaciated at the Last Glacial Maximum, but glacial climate and changes in base level (the water level at the mouth of the river) due to glacial advance and retreat had far-reaching impacts on this watershed. The Whitewater River was further altered by the start of Euro-American farming in the 1850s, which resulted in vegetation clearing and the introduction of plowing. These land use changes had devastating consequences on this landscape, resulting in massive floods and debris flows that buried towns and destroyed farmland.

In my research I am:
1. Comparing catchment averaged erosion and aggradation in post-glacial vs post-settlement time
2. Modeling knickpoint formation and channel long profile chronology in mixed alluvial-bedrock rivers
3.  Examining impacts of land use, lithology, and base level on catchment averaged erosion within a river system.

I am passionate about connecting landscapes, processes, and scientific approaches in new and exciting ways. I'm eager to talk more about my research and to collaborate with new people. Please do not hesitate to contact me to talk science!
