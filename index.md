Hello! My name is Shanti and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My work focuses broadly on how river systems respond to changes in *base level*, or the water level at a river's mouth. To understand this, I study *river channel long profile*, the slope from the river headwaters to the mouth, to see how river slope adjusts as the water level at the mouth changes. My work also touches on key themes in geochronology, computational modeling, and glaciation. To learn more about my research interests, visit my [Research Page](https://spenprase.github.io/research).
