Hello! My name is Shanti and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My work focuses broadly on how river systems respond to changes in climate, *base level* (the water level at a river's mouth), and sedimentation (either driven by glaciers or human agriculture). To understand this, I study *river channel long profile*, the slope from the river headwaters to the mouth, to see how river slope adjusts as the water level at the mouth changes and *fluvial terraces*, abandoned floodplains, once occupied by a river. My work uses a number of techniques including geochronology, GIS, working with sediment cores, and computational modeling. To learn more about my research interests, visit my [Research Page](https://spenprase.github.io/research).

In addition to research, I also love working with students and have been fortunate to work with several undergraduate classes as both a guest lecturer and a teaching assistant. I love working with students and finding what makes them passionate in order to help them get excited about the landscapes around them.
