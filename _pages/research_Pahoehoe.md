# The Rift Across Lake Superior
Lake Superior's dramatic landscape owes much to a massive geological rift that formed over a billion years ago. This rift, known as the Midcontinent Rift, split the Earth's crust and created a deep basin that eventually filled with water to become Lake Superior. The rifting process involved intense volcanic activity, with lava flows and sediment deposits shaping the region's bedrock. Today, the evidence of this ancient rift can be seen in the lake's unique geology and the surrounding terrain.
