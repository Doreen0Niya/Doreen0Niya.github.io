I have been fortunate to collaborate on several co-authored research publications from work in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Each of these projects has since been published (see publications page).
# Southern Patagonian Ice Field
## Last Glacial Maximum Retreat of the Lago Argentino Outlet Lobe

In this collaborative project (led by Matias Romero, University of Wisconsin Madison), we constrain the ice lobe retreat and paraglacial landscape response of the Lago Argentino outlet lobe of the Southern Patagonian Ice Sheet. The project uses remotely sensed data and field-based geochronology (<sup>10</sup>Be and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL)) to map and date glacial features in the Rio Santa Cruz Valley, on the edge of Lago Argentino in southern Patagonia, Argentina. For this project, I collected processed IRSL samples of landforms in the valley to further develop the paraglacial evolution of the valley.

## Automated Ablation Stakes
Using supplies purchased from the hardware store (thanks Home Depot!) we assembled and installed automated ablation stakes on the Perito Moreno Glacier in Spring of 2020. This project is led by Andrew Wickert at the University of Minnesota and combines data from ablation stakes installed in several glacial landscapes.

## Increasing 21st Century Melt in Patagonian Rivers
Using fluvial discharge data from the Patagonian Ice Sheet, first author Dr. Max Van Wyk De Vries (University of Cambridge) related increasing fluvial runoff to increased air temperatures in the 20th-century. This work demonstrates how modern warming is increasing proglacial meltwater runoff and quantifies how meltwater from the Patagonian Ice Sheet is shifting in the most recent several decades.
