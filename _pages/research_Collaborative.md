excerpt: I'm interested in how **climate and deglaciation dictate process and morphology of landscapes across timescales, from thousand-year deglacial climate change to modern, anthropogenic shifts.**

## Last Glacial Maximum retreat of the Lago Argentino Outlet Lobe

In this collaborative project (led by Matias Romero, University of Wisconsin Madison), we are working to constrain the ice lobe retreat and paraglacial landscape response of the Lago Argentino outlet lobe of the Southern Patagonian Ice Sheet. The project uses remotely sensed data and field-based geochronology (<sup>10</sup>Be and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL)) to map and date glacial features in the Rio Santa Cruz Valley, on the edge of Lago Argentino in southern Patagonia, Argentina. For this project, I collected processed IRSL samples of landforms in the valley to further develop the paraglacial evolution of the valley.
