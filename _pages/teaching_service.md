# Service and Community Building
## AGU EPSP Graduate Student Mentoring Program & University of Minnesota Graduate Mentoring
I helped found the AGU Earth & Planetary Surface Processes (EPSP) Graduate Student Mentoring Program in Fall 2022, and sucessfully helped manage the program for two years with over fifty international participants. The program continues to run every year and is managed by the EPSP Student Committee. [More info on the program can be found here.](https://connect.agu.org/epsp/discussion/mentoring-program)

## Association for Women Geoscientists (AWG) Minnesota
I served as a board member for the Association for Women Geoscientists Minnesota chapter for three years and helped organize and host an AWG distinguished seminar speaker in the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences.

## UMN Graduate Research Symposium
I served for two years on the organizing committee for the annual, two-day UMN Student Reserach Symposium (EarthSRS). During this time we hosted the symposium in-person and virtually, with over fifty attendees, a keynote speaker, and presentations from twenty graduate and undergraduate students accross the Departments of Earth & Environmental Sciences and Soil, Water, & Climate at the University of Minnesota. 
## Outreach Events
In addition to my teaching experience, **I have served as a direct research advisor, senior thesis committee member, and research collaborator for a number of undergraduate students**. Several of my students have generated independent research projects and presented their research in a number of public formats. As a mentor **I work to build a project plan with each of my students to address their specific research and skill building goals during our work together**.
