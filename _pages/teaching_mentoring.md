# Undergraduate Mentoring
## Undergraduate Research Advising
As a mentor, I work to provide a structured and collaborative introduction to research for my students. I have designed and completed several projects for undergraduate students from both my own research projects and in collaboration with individual students to build projects based around their interests. **I have directly supervised six undergraduate research projects and served on the undergraduate thesis committee for two students, with many of my students coming from under-represented communities in Earth Sciences.**
