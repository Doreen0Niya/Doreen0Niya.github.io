excerpt: My teaching and mentoring approach is focused on active learning, building an inclusive classroom environment, and a student-driven focus to assess learning outcomes. I strive to position myself as a resource for students, where I serve as an instructor and collaborator for each student to achieve learning goals.

# Teaching
I work with my students to build knowledge, confidence, and the skills to critically exampine the complex, interacting, and interdisciplinary nature of climate, glaciation, and Earth surface processes. I love working with students as they develop their interests and professional goals. I have pursued teaching opportunities throughout my academic career and hold a teaching certificate from the [Preparing Future Faculty](https://cei.umn.edu/programs/preparing-future-faculty-program) curriculum at the University of Minnesota.

## Teaching at Dartmouth College

I am teaching **Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (EARS 33)**, an upper-level undergraduate course in Dartmouth's Earth Sciences Department in Spring 2026 as part of my postdoctoral fellowship. **This course is heavily focused on building essential student skills in working with spatial datasets in GIS (ArcPro, QGIS, GRASS GIS) and understanding landscape processes through field, lab, and classroom activities.** <i>In addition to teaching at Dartmouth, I am also directly supervising several undergraduate research students (see Undergraduate Research Advising below).</i>

# Undergraduate Mentoring
## Undergraduate Research Advising
As a mentor, I work to provide a structured and collaborative introduction to research for my students. I have designed and completed several projects for undergraduate students from both my own research projects and in collaboration with individual students to build projects based around their interests. **I have directly supervised six undergraduate research projects and served on the undergraduate thesis committee for two students, with many of my students coming from under-represented communities in Earth Sciences.**

# Service and Community Building
## AGU EPSP Graduate Student Mentoring Program & University of Minnesota Graduate Mentoring
I helped found the AGU Earth & Planetary Surface Processes (EPSP) Graduate Student Mentoring Program in Fall 2022, and sucessfully helped manage the program for two years with over fifty international participants. The program continues to run every year and is managed by the EPSP Student Committee. [More info on the program can be found here.](https://connect.agu.org/epsp/discussion/mentoring-program)

## Association for Women Geoscientists (AWG) Minnesota
I served as a board member for the Association for Women Geoscientists Minnesota chapter for three years and helped organize and host an AWG distinguished seminar speaker in the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences.

## UMN Graduate Research Symposium
I served for two years on the organizing committee for the annual, two-day UMN Student Reserach Symposium (EarthSRS). During this time we hosted the symposium in-person and virtually, with over fifty attendees, a keynote speaker, and presentations from twenty graduate and undergraduate students accross the Departments of Earth & Environmental Sciences and Soil, Water, & Climate at the University of Minnesota. 
## Outreach Events
In addition to my teaching experience, **I have served as a direct research advisor, senior thesis committee member, and research collaborator for a number of undergraduate students**. Several of my students have generated independent research projects and presented their research in a number of public formats. As a mentor **I work to build a project plan with each of my students to address their specific research and skill building goals during our work together**.
