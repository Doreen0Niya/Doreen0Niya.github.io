excerpt: My teaching and mentoring approach is focused on active learning, building an inclusive classroom environment, and a student-driven focus to assess learning outcomes. I strive to position myself as a resource for students, where I serve as an instructor and collaborator for each student to achieve learning goals.

# Undergraduate Mentoring
## Research Advising
<p>
As a mentor, I work to provide a structured and collaborative introduction to research for my students. I have designed and completed several projects for undergraduate students from both my own research projects and in collaboration with individual students to build projects based around their interests. <strong>I have directly supervised six undergraduate research projects and served on the undergraduate thesis committee for two students, with many of my students coming from under-represented communities in Earth Sciences.</strong>
