excerpt: I strive to position myself in the classroom as a resource for students, where I serve as an instructor and collaborator for each student to achieve learning goals. **My teaching approach is focused on active learning, building an inclusive classroom environment, and a student-driven focus to assess teaching outcomes.**

In addition to my teaching experience, **I have served as a direct research advisor, senior thesis committee member, and research collaborator for a number of undergraduate students**. Several of my students have generated independent research projects and presented their research in a number of public formats. As a mentor **I work to build a project plan with each of my students to address their specific research and skill building goals during our work together**.
