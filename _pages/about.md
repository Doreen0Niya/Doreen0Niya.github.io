I study the impacts of climate, deglaciation, and humans on Earth's landscapes using a combination of field-based and remote-sensing approaches. My work spans a wide range of timescales, from the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago to the modern day.

I am currently the Guarini Dean's Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. I received my PhD from the University of Minnesota and graduated from Carleton College with a BA in Geology. Before starting my PhD I worked for a few years in the non-profit and local government sectors focusing on community outreach and public education relating to water pollution in the Twin Cities Metro Area.
