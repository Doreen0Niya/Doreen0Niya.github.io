I am currently working at Dartmouth College as the Guarini Dean's Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Earth Sciences. I study the impacts of climate, deglaciation, and humans on Earth's landscapes using a combination of field-based and remote-sensing approaches. My work spans a wide range of timescales, from the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago to the modern day.

Outside of work, I love hiking, swimming, yoga, baking, and reading historical fiction.

* PhD, University of Minnesota
  * Thesis: <i>"Sediment, Water, Change: Post-Glacial to Post-Settlement evolution of the Upper Mississippi River Valley"</i>
* BA, Carleton College, <i>Geology</i>
