<b>This project uses remote sensing to understand sedimentation processes of alluvial fans in the Richardson and Mackenzie Mountains of Canada's Arctic.</b> It is part of a manuscript in prep (see publications page).

# Overview Video 
Check out the video below to learn more about the project, my research, and see some awesome footage of the Aklavik Range.

## Project Framing
<i>The processes governing alluvial fan formation in Arctic, permafrost regions are uniquely sensitive to changes in climate and frost-based erosional processes. In this project I use remote sensing of fans in the Aklavik Range, Northwest Territories, Canada to study sediment transport and fan accumulation processes unique to periglacial settings.</i>
