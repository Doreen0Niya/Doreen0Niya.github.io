# Deglacial versus human-induced erosion rates in the Upper Mississippi River Valley

Euro-American settlement irrevocably altered the landscapes of the Upper Midwest and dramatically increased erosion and sedimentation within river valleys.

## Project Framing
This work, published in <i>Geology</i> and featured on <i>Science.org</i>, is focused understanding how changes in climate, glaciation, and land use impact the morphology of river catchments. The project connects landscapes of the icy past from the Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 20,000 years ago) to more modern changes caused by Euro-American farming and paraglacial (or post-glacial) landscape evolution.

## Using geochronology to study paleoerosion rate
To build a paleoerosion rate chronology, I pair cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and optically stimulated luminescence dating. I relate pre-agricultural paleoerosion rate variability to paleoclimatic change and compare these shifts to increases seen post-Euro-American settlement.

I completed lab work for this project at the UMass Amherst Cosmogenic Nuclide Laboratory with Prof. Isaac Larsen and at the Utah State Luminescence Laboatory with Prof. Tammy Rittenour.
