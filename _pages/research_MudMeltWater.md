<b><i>Using slackwater sediments and fluival terraces, I completed two projects studying how river systems in the Upper Mississippi River Valley both record and are recovering from the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.</i></b> 
# Slackwater sediments: geochemical records of meltwater change

Slackwater sediments are deposited at the mouths of tributaries due to inundation by water along the mainstem river. These fine-grained deposits preserve sediments carried down the mainstem river.

In this project, I worked with UMN Undergraduate Abigail Wilwerding, to understand the source of glacially-derived slackwater sediments collected near the mouth of our field area in southeastern Minnesota.

To identify sediment provenance for this project and reconstruct past glacial meltwater routing down the Mississippi River, we used a combination of sediment core description, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF).

# Downstream signatures of deglaciation on fluvial systems

As the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated after the Last Glacial Maximum, pulses of glacial sediment and meltwater dramatically altered base level for tributaries connected to the (then proglacial) Mississippi River.

</figure>

By pairing glacial chronology with river channel long profile evolution and bedrock morphology during this period, we are able to build a field-based dataset that demonstrates how rivers respond to changing base level without additional tectonic signals. This, in turn, allows us to test models of how transport-limited river systems respond to perturbations using real world, physically-based data.
