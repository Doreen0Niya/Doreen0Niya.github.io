excerpt: I'm interested in how climate and deglaciation dictate process and morphology of landscapes across timescales, from thousand-year deglacial climate change to modern, anthropogenic shifts. I address my research questions using a number of approaches, including remote sensing, laboratory experimentation, field measurements, and geochronology (optically stimulated luminescence and <sup>10</sup>Be cosmogenic nuclide dating).<br><br> <i>Please feel free to click through each project to learn more about it. **For my publications, see the publications tab above.**</i>

    excerpt: "I study how deglacial landscapes evolve over time and respond to climatic and athropogenic perturbations using a combination of field, lab, and modeling approaches. My research interests include post-glacial and Arctic landscape evolution, geochronology, and remote sensing."

My current research is focused on **periglacial landscape evolution and Arctic alluvial fan formation processes**. I have also completed projects focused on understanding how **changes in climate, glaciation, and land use impact the morphology of river catchments** and connecting landscapes of the icy past during the Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 20,000 years ago) to more modern changes caused by Euro-American farming and paraglacial (or post-glacial) landscape evolution. 

I address my research questions using a number of approaches, including remote sensing, laboratory experimentation, field measurements, and geochronology (optically stimulated luminescence and <sup>10</sup>Be cosmogenic nuclide dating).
