excerpt: My research is focused on understanding how **changes in climate, glaciation, and land use impact the morphology of river catchments**. My work connects landscapes of the icy past during the Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 20,000 years ago) to more modern changes caused by Euro-American farming and paraglacial (or post-glacial) landscape evolution. <br><br>I address my research questions using a number of approaches, including optically stimulated luminescence and <sup>10</sup>Be cosmogenic nuclide dating, DEM analysis of watershed-scale morphology and channel networks, detailed sediment description, and passive/active source seismic methods.

## Research Projects
### Axe vs Ice Age: Human and climatic impacts on erosion rates in the Whitewater River Basin
 
Euro-American settlement irrevocably altered the landscapes of the Upper Midwest and dramatically increased erosion and sedimentation within river valleys. In this project I use a paired geochronology (cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and optically stimulated luminescence) approach to construct a pre-settlement, late Pleistocene paleoerosion chronology to better contextualize the impacts of Euro-American agriculture on this landscape. I additionally relate paleoerosion rate variability to paleoenvironmental shifts prior to settlement.

### Glacially modulated base level change impacts on channel long profile

As the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated after the Last Glacial Maximum, pulses of glacial sediment and meltwater dramatically altered base level for tributaries connected to the then proglacial Mississippi River. By pairing glacial chronology with river channel long profile evolution and bedrock morphology during this period, we are able to build a field-based dataset that demonstrates how rivers respond to changing base level without additional tectonic signals. This, in turn, allows us to test models of how transport-limited river systems respond to perturbations using real world, physically-based data.

### Undergraduate Advisee: <br>Identifying Provenance of Glacially-Derived Outwash Sediments

In this project, I am supervising UMN Undergraduate Abigail Wilwerding, to understand the source of glacially-derived slackwater sediments collected near the mouth of our field area in southeastern Minnesota. We are using a combination of core description, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to identify these sediments and relate their deposition to past glacial meltwater routing down the Mississippi River. This project aids our understanding glacial sedimentation and sediment sourcing of the Mississippi River during the most recent glacial period.

#### Kettle Lake Morphology

This project (currently led by Jillian Prescott, University of Wisconsin Madison), explores the relationship between ice sphere volume and burial depth to kettle depression morphology. I will be expanding upon her initial study (Prescott et al, Accepted) to build a larger dataset for kettle lake formation morphologies using new testing parameters and applying these laboratory findings to field settings. 

#### Research Collaboration: <br>Last Glacial Maximum retreat of the Lago Argentino Outlet Lobe

In this collaborative project (led by Matias Romero, University of Wisconsin Madison), we are working to constrain the ice lobe retreat and paraglacial landscape response of the Lago Argentino outlet lobe of the Southern Patagonian Ice Sheet. The project uses remotely sensed data and field-based geochronology (<sup>10</sup>Be and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL)) to map and date glacial features in the Rio Santa Cruz Valley, on the edge of Lago Argentino in southern Patagonia, Argentina. For this project, I collected processed IRSL samples of landforms in the valley to further develop the paraglacial evolution of the valley.
