excerpt: Geoscientists study how rivers shape landscapes through erosion, sediment transport, and deposition. River erosion carves valleys, forms channels, and exposes bedrock, while processes like rock fracturing influence the development of landforms and the movement of water and sediments over time.

Geoscientific research encompasses a wide range of topics, including river dynamics, sedimentology, volcanic processes, and landscape evolution. Our interests span the investigation of how natural forces shape the Earth's surface, the interaction between water and rock, and the long-term impacts of geological events on ecosystems.

**Featured Project: Subsurface Mapping of Ancient River Channels**

We are currently developing a project focused on using ground-penetrating radar and sediment core analysis to map buried river channels in the Upper Midwest. This research aims to reconstruct paleoenvironments, understand historical water flow patterns, and assess how ancient rivers influenced present-day landforms and groundwater resources.
