  caption: Alluvial fans in the Aklavik Range, NWT, Canada
excerpt: I'm interested in how climate and deglaciation dictate process and morphology of landscapes across timescales, from thousand-year deglacial climate change to modern, anthropogenic shifts.

    excerpt: "**Periglacial** landscapes, or **landscapes shaped by active freeze-thaw processes and/or in proximity to glaciers**, are the first phase of processes that change the landscape following glaciation. This work focuses on two major landforms found in cold regions: alluvial fans and kettle lakes."

    excerpt: "**Paraglacial** landscapes, or **landscapes recovering from the impacts of glaciation**, can still be shaped by glacially-driven processes thousands of years after ice retreat. In the Upper Mississippi River Valley, I address questions spanning from the Last Glacial Maximum to Euro-American settlement to understand how river systems are shaped by changes in climate, erosion rate, and post-glacial processes."

I address my research questions using a number of approaches, including **remote sensing, laboratory experimentation, field measurements, and geochronology (optically stimulated luminescence and <sup>10</sup>Be cosmogenic nuclide dating).**<br><br><i>Please feel free to click through each project to learn more about what I'm working on.</i>
