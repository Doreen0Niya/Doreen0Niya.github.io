##Education

2018-Present (expected 2024): **Ph.D. Candidate**, Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences, the University of Minnesota Twin Cities

2012-2016: **Bachelor of Arts, Geology**, Carleton College

## Research Interests

My research is focused on interactions between glaciers and rivers and understanding how changes in glaciation impact the shape and behavior of rivers around them. I'm focusing this work on two field areas in southeastern Minnesota and Argentina. My research uses a wide range of tools including many geochronological methods, working with remote datasets, and (my favorite) lots of fieldwork.

## Research Areas
Fluvial geomorphology, fluvial and glacial systems, optically stimulated luminescence, cosmogenic nuclide dating, geochronology, remote sensing

## Teaching

*“The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.”*-- Ralph Sockman

 This quote, by Ralph Sockman, in my mind, best summarizes my approach to teaching. In the classroom, my primary goal is to help students "build their island of knowledge" through engaging, collaborative discussion and application of subject material. This, in turn, fosters wonder and independent engagement for each student.

 Students learn best when they are in an exciting, engaging, and supportive environment where they are able to ask questions and pursue intriguing lines of reasoning. An ideal classroom is collaborative, applied and engaging. As a teacher, I strive to position myself in the classroom as a resource for students, one where students see me as not only means to help them better understand and engage with course content, but also one that is able to support them and help them build learning skills that can be applied beyond my class. These skills include how best to learn material, how to communicate effectively, and how to be part of an active, working team.

 My teaching experience includes invited guest lectures in Hydrology and Geochronology and Teaching Assistant roles in courses ranging from Geomorphology, Earth Surface Processes, and Introduction to Earth & the Environment.
