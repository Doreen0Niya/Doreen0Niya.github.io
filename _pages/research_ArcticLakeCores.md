# Lakes as an Archive
Lakes are a valuable record of landscape change and in the Arctic, where processes are particularly sensitive to changes in climate, lake sediment records preserve changes over time.

## Project Framing
In this project, which I am developing into an NSF proposal with several collaborators at Dartmouth College, we will explore how changes in climate over the Holocene impacted sedimentation and sediment transport in the Arctic.

The project is focused on several lakes in the Aklavik Range of the Richardson Mountains, NWT, Canada. Our lakes include those who actively receive sediment from the Aklavik Range and others that remain isolated and perched on the plateau.

This paired study will answer key questions on how changing climate could result in increased sediment transport and sedimentation in Arctic regions.

# Preliminary Data Collection: Summer 2025
We collected preliminary data for this project in Summer 2025 from a lake in the Aklavik Range. This preliminary data included bathymetry, a gravity core of lake sediments, and tile probing of the lake bottom to understand potential lake grain size and sediment depth.

In addition to our in-depth data collection at one lake, we scouted several other lakes in the region and looked at lake inlets and outlets to better understand how sediment moves through this system.
