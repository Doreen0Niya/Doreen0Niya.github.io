##Education

2018-Present (expected 2024): **Ph.D. Candidate**, Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences, the University of Minnesota Twin Cities

2012-2016: **Bachelor of Arts, Geology**, Carleton College

## Research Interests

My research is focused on understanding how changes in glaciation impact the morphology and dynamics of river networks. My work is primarily focused on the Whitewater River, a tributary to the Mississippi River in southeastern Minnesota, USA.

My research is centered around three main questions:
1. How do the changes in water and sediment supply and changes in base level caused by ice sheets impact downstream and tributary river systems?
2. How do changes in erosion and deposition evolve across different timescales?
As the watershed transitioned from ancient bedrock erosion to terrace aggradation and abandonment, how did erosion rates change?
3. How do mixed alluvial-bedrock systems respond to changes in base level in real, natural systems? Can we do ground-truthing of models for this evolution?

I address these key research questions through a number of methods, including optically stimulated luminescence and meteoric cosmogenic nuclide dating, DEM analysis of watershed-scale morphology and channel networks, detailed sediment descriptions, and passive/active source seismic.

## Research Areas
Fluvial geomorphology, fluvial and glacial systems, optically stimulated luminescence, cosmogenic nuclide dating, geochronology, remote sensing

## Teaching

*“The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.”*-- Ralph Sockman

 This quote, by Ralph Sockman, in my mind, best summarizes my approach to teaching. In the classroom, my primary goal is to help students "build their island of knowledge" through engaging, collaborative discussion and application of subject material. This, in turn, fosters wonder and independent engagement for each student.

 Students learn best when they are in an exciting, engaging, and supportive environment where they are able to ask questions and pursue intriguing lines of reasoning. An ideal classroom is collaborative, applied and engaging. As a teacher, I strive to position myself in the classroom as a resource for students, one where students see me as not only means to help them better understand and engage with course content, but also one that is able to support them and help them build learning skills that can be applied beyond my class. These skills include how best to learn material, how to communicate effectively, and how to be part of an active, working team.

 My teaching experience includes invited guest lectures in Hydrology and Geochronology and Teaching Assistant roles in courses ranging from Geomorphology, Earth Surface Processes, and Introduction to Earth & the Environment.
