## *“The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.”*-- Ralph Sockman

 I love this quote, by Ralph Sockman, because in the classroom I feel passionately that students learn best when they feel wonder for what they are learning. As an educator, I strive to help students "build their island of knowledge" through engaging, collaborative discussion and application of subject material. This, in turn, fosters wonder and independent engagement for each student.

 As a teacher, I strive to position myself in the classroom as a resource for students, one where students see me as not only means to help them better understand and engage with course content, but also one that is able to support them and help them build learning skills that can be applied beyond my class. These skills include how best to learn material, how to communicate effectively, and how to be part of an active, working team.

 I have completed the [Preparing Future Faculty](https://cei.umn.edu/programs/preparing-future-faculty-program) curriculum offered at the University of Minnesota and hold a certificate for Teaching in Higher Education earned through completing the foundational Teaching in Higher Education and Practicum course requirements for the program.

 My teaching experience includes **invited guest lectures and assignment generation** for **Geomorphology**, **Advanced Geomorphology**, and **Surface & Groundwater Hydrology**.

 In addition, I have **Teaching Assistant** experience for courses ranging from  **Geomorphology**, **Field Hydrogeology**, **Earth Surface Processes**, and **Introduction to Earth & the Environment**.
