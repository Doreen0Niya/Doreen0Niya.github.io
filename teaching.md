## *“The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.”*-- Ralph Sockman

 This quote, by Ralph Sockman, in my mind, best summarizes my approach to teaching. In the classroom, my primary goal is to help students "build their island of knowledge" through engaging, collaborative discussion and application of subject material. This, in turn, fosters wonder and independent engagement for each student.

 Students learn best when they are in an exciting, engaging, and supportive environment where they are able to ask questions and pursue intriguing lines of reasoning. As a teacher, I strive to position myself in the classroom as a resource for students, one where students see me as not only means to help them better understand and engage with course content, but also one that is able to support them and help them build learning skills that can be applied beyond my class. These skills include how best to learn material, how to communicate effectively, and how to be part of an active, working team.

 My teaching experience includes invited guest lectures in Hydrology and Geochronology and Teaching Assistant roles in courses ranging from Geomorphology, Earth Surface Processes, and Introduction to Earth & the Environment.
